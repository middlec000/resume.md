## Research and Publications
### <span>Homelessness Prediction | Spokane Predictive Analytics | Spokane, WA </span> <span>June 2020 --- October 2023</span>
 - [Middleton, Colin D., et al. "The value of utility payment history in predicting first-time homelessness." Plos one 18.10 (2023): e0292305.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292305).
